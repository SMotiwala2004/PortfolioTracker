Portfolio Tracker

Technologies Used: ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Python(Flask), robin_stocks API

The utilization of the technologies listed above, allowed me to create my first full stack application. While not the cleanest UX design for a website, this project focuses on the usage of frontend and backend technologies to come together and allow me to track my Robinhood portfolio. While I've done a few front-end and back-end projects, I've never combined the two. Doing so in this project tought me valuable skills such as accessing and creating endpoints as well connecting the two ends. The main motivation behind this project stemmed from the thought of learning Python skills. What better way to do so when I'm looking to dabble into the stock market as well? This web app allows me to track my watchlists and stocks, as well as receive news without accessing Robinhood
